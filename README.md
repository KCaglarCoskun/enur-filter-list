# Unrelated Recommendations Filter List for English Websites
A filter list that filters unrelated recommendations in websites. It can be used via filtering/blocking software such as adblock and ublock. It is written with compliance to abp organization filter guidelines.

This list is under development.

A list of recommendations in a website will be blocked if it includes unrelated recommendations (even if there are just a few of them)

Relatedness is relative. An example of relatedness as defined in this project is: in a webpage which presents a critic of a movie, there is a sidebar where there are other recommendations for articles. A recommendation for a critic for another movie or an article about the same movie is relative enough. A critic about a song should be considered unrelated. A news item about a car crash is definetly unrelated.
A list of items that have the same tag as the item at hand should be considered unrelated and filtered. i.e. a tag is not defined as sufficiently related.
