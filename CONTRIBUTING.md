#### Examples of recommendations that should be blocked: ####
* Most recommendations in sidebars of magazine websites
* Youtube recommendations include very few unrelated recommendations but they still do. As a result, they are blocked.
* Stack Exchange "Hot Network Questions" list should be blocked since the entries are unrelated to the question at hand.

#### Examples of recommendations that should not be blocked: ####
* Stack Exchange "Linked" and "Related" lists should not be blocked since they are related to the question.

### Modules That Should not be Blocked ###
Webpages that provide recommendations only and don't have a particular topic. Lots of homepages are in this category e.g. youtube.com/ or homepages of magazine/newspaper websites.

Obviously: Search bars and search results should not be blocked
