This filter list is written with compliance to adblock plus filter guidelines: https://adblockplus.org/en/filters

#### Examples of recommendations that should be blocked: ####
* Most recommendations in sidebars of magazine websites
* Youtube sidebar recommendations include lots of recommendations that are unrelated to the video being watched. They are all somehow related to watch history but relatedness in this project is relative to the topic at hand. As a result, they are blocked.
* Stack Exchange "Hot Network Questions" list should be blocked since the entries are unrelated to the question at hand.

#### Examples of recommendations that should not be blocked: ####
* Stack Exchange "Linked" and "Related" lists should not be blocked since they are related to the question.

### Modules That Should not be Blocked ###
* Webpages that provide recommendations only and don't have a particular topic. Lots of homepages are in this category e.g. youtube.com/ or homepages of magazine/newspaper websites.
* Obviously: Search bars and search results should not be blocked

### Sorting ###
Grouping similar filters is cannon. Alphabetical sorting is not strictly necessary since ctrl+f replaces this need. It is preferred though.

### Comments ###
Comments for every filter is desired. Comments should be positioned over the filter.
